The blue stars running on my forehead
Cold wings fluttering and moving
Mushrooms everywhere I'm turning
Laced with love, intensive grooving
They said, they said

I know how to make you go crazy every day
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah (ah)
Tease your mind and trick you, you really wanna stay
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah (ah)

I know the way to make you lose your pace
Your trace, your trace
If you wanna ride with the magic
Lose sight of the gravity of weight

Lips of sugar, I'm breathing the pheromones again
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah (ah)
Hands are tied and Miranda Rights don't mean nothing

Led me astray to the faerie soir√©e
Alone, alone
Now I wanna ride with the magic
Lose sight of the gravity of home

Blue stars running on my forehead
Cold wings fluttering and moving
Mushrooms everywhere I'm turning
Laced with love, intensive grooving
They said, they said
They said

Somewhere on Venus, they're searching for me
While I'm covered in muck from the earth and the sea
Scratching this carcass like dogs with the fleas
I keep leaning to dying in all of my dreams

Gather me, all of we, everyone
I've been the boys and the girls
And everyone in between

Gather me, all of we, everyone
I've been the boys and the girls
And everyone in between
